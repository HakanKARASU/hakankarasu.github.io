									<h1>Non-linear catalyst deactivation through explainable artificial intelligence</h1>
									<p>Using Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn to create a machine learning model that would 
										predict whether or not a player is a starter.
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Presentation10.pdf" alt="" /></div>
								<h3>Key Goals</h3>
								<p>Explainable Predictive Modeling: Create an AI model that forecasts catalyst behavior and process outcomes, reducing the reliance on extended experimental tests. This model will offer clear explanations for its predictions, making them accessible to experts in the field.
								<p>
								<p>Pattern Recognition: Employ machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from experimental data, which will aid in predicting the lifespan of catalysts and identifying the factors that contribute to their degradation.
								</p>
								</p>Root Cause Analysis: Use AI to conduct a thorough analysis of complex data to pinpoint the primary reasons for catalyst degradation. The findings will assist in the development of strategies to prevent or minimize degradation.
								</p>
								<p>Decision Support: Develop an AI-based support system that can evaluate the effects of different operational variables on the stability of catalysts and the selectivity of the production process. 
								</p>
								<p>My conclusion on the results is that the outcome provides good insight onto further research that needs to be done. The results 
									show that there are some underlying stats that provide insight into what makes a player a starter. But it would be best practice 
									to build out a model to compare this model against that would break down the players by position (or at least by front court and back court).
									This would require more data (at least the past 5 years, possible the past 10) to get adequate sample size.
								</p>
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
								<p>In future models and a revision of this model I need to find ways to incorporate more data. Having only one season of data resulted in 148 starters and 248
									backups after filtering players out for lack of games played and lack of minutes per game (sample size issues). Using the previous 5 
									seasons of player data would have provided a much better sample size while also having the parameters of the game kept relatively the
									same (i.e., not a lot of rule changes or dramatic difference in style of play). To make this model work for a single season, I made sure
									to use cross-validation. However, it would have been better to use both cross validation and multiple seasons of data.
